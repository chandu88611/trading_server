Kite server (TypeORM + TypeScript)

This is a minimal TypeScript project using TypeORM to connect to Postgres. It intentionally includes no HTTP API — it only initializes the DB connection and performs a small sample query.

Steps:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit DB settings.
2. npm install
3. npm run build
4. npm start

Or for development:

npm run dev
